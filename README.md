## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- nltk
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow (or pytorch)
- spaCy
- gensim

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn nltk scikit-learn tensorflow spacy gensim
```

Additionally, download the necessary NLTK data:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

And download the spaCy language model:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Install the Requirements:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Make sure to have the required NLTK data and spaCy model as mentioned in the [Requirements](#requirements) section.

## Usage

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

   Start Jupyter Notebook in the project directory and open `chatbot.ipynb`:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Run the Notebook:**

   Follow the instructions in the notebook to run each cell. The notebook is organized into sections, each covering different aspects of building a chatbot using NLP techniques.
